{"name":"Adler Teens ","tagline":"","body":"### A Day in the Life of an Adler Teen Intern!  \r\n  At the Adler Planetarium teen interns have the option to partake in various professional opportunities based on their interests and skills. There are 6 categories and 16 interns are chosen every year. The categories are: Citizen Science,Social Media, Far Horizons, Public Programs, Research/Writing and Summer Camp Intern positions. \r\n\r\n### Summer Camp Counselor Position\r\nSummer Camp Interns work with elementary and middle school aged students in the Adler's many summer camps. These camps provide great experiences for children which help them learn how to explore the universe around them. The activities vary from parachute design to programming robots. Teen interns assist camp counselors with daily tasks, take photos and videos of both campers and activities, and interact with the campers. This position helps students develop strong professional skills -listening and explaining, the ability to mentor younger learners, group management, experience with audio-visual digital media technology and an understanding of concepts in space science and astronomy. \r\n\r\n### \r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
